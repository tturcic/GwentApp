## Synopsis

A sample project based on MVP, Dagger 2 for Dependency Injection, Retrofit (comboed with Rx) for Networking and Realm database.
Uses on open source API to fetch data, store it in database and present to the user.

## Motivation

Projects I professionally work on rarely allow me to try out MVP, Dagger 2 and other Android goodies.
Gwent API used by the app was presented on Reddit a while ago and I couldn't resist trying it out.
